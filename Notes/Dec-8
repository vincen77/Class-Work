want bulma and font awesome in dev dependencies

want sass

crtl c on next app
    npm i
        npm run dev
        
(Next.js)
we installed bulma but never imported it
    next.js has built in routing
        takes the page in files folder, and uses that to build router
            app.tsx is very similar to our app.vue (similar idea)
            index.tsx is similar in concept to our views/homeview.

    import bulma in 

const NavVue = ()=> <div></div> (this is how you make a component)
                ^ this is a function
        
nav.tsx
