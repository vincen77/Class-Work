Name: Diego V. Miranda

Hello! This is my "Readme" for my homework assignment!
To start, i'd like to mention that my
preferred nickname is "Vincent" which is my
middle name. As for a photo, i will attach my
most recent selfie haha.

Now to answer your questions..

-In terms of computer experience, i would still say i am
fairly new. I've taken all the basic Computer Science and Computer engineering classes
languages such as Java, C/C++, Basic Python, HTML and CSS, and Assembly, along with other
classes such as Software engineering, digital logic, OOP, Language Processing, and others that i currently
cannot remember, haha. As for projects, i've worked on a video game project in software engineering with 5/6 other people
and my role was to create interactive objects doors in unity.

-For what i hope to gain from this class is the knowledge and skills to create my
own websites and apps that i can use in the future to help my hobbies or any
future businesses i plan to create or take part in!
