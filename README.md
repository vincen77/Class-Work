Hello! This is my "Readme" for my homework assignment!
To start, i'd like to mention that my
preferred nickname is "Vincent" which is my
middle name. As for a photo, i will attach my
most recent selfie haha.

Now to answer your questions..

-In terms of computer experience, i would still say i am
fairly new. I've taken all the basic Computer Science and Computer engineering classes
languages such as Java, C/C++, Basic Python, HTML and CSS, and Assembly, along with other
classes such as Software engineering, digital logic, OOP, Language Processing, and others that i currently
cannot remember, haha. As for projects, i've worked on a video game project in software engineering with 5/6 other people
and my role was to create interactive objects doors in unity.

-For what i hope to gain from this class is the knowledge and skills to create my
own websites and apps that i can use in the future to help my hobbies or any
future businesses i plan to create or take part in!
